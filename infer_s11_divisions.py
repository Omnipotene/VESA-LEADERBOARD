Infer S11 division placements based on ranking distribution
Since we don't have explicit division data for S11, we'll estimate based on:
- Top 40 players (~30%) -> Pinnacle I (score 10)
- Next 30 players (~23%) -> Pinnacle II (score 8)
- Next 30 players (~23%) -> Vanguard (score 8)
- Remaining players -> Lower divisions (score 6, 4)

This is a reasonable approximation based on typical competitive distribution
